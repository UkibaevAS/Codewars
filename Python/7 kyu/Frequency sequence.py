DESCRIPTION:
Your task is to return an output string that translates an input string s by replacing each character in
s with a number representing the number of times that character occurs in s and separating each number
with the sep character(s).

Example (s, sep --> Output)

"hello world", "-" --> "1-1-3-3-2-1-1-2-1-3-1"
"19999999"   , ":" --> "1:7:7:7:7:7:7:7"
"^^^**$"     , "x" --> "3x3x3x2x2x1"

    return f'{sep}'.join(str(s.count(i)) for i in s)
